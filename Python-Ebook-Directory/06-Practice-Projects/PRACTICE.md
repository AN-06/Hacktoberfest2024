Question:
Take the `number_guessing` example and enhance it: store the best (lowest) number of tries into a local file `highscore.txt` and display it each run. Add optional maximum attempts.

Hints:
- Use file I/O to read/write the high score and `try/except` to handle missing file.
- Keep gameplay logic in functions so it's easy to test.

Beginner project to showcase on resume:
- "Number Guessing Game (CLI)" — polished README, how to run, and example play-through.

Advanced extension:
- Build a web-based version with user accounts, leaderboards, and a small frontend (Flask + simple HTML/CSS or a tiny React frontend).
