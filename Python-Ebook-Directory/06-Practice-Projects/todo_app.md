# Todo App (Text-based)

A simple todo list application that stores tasks in a text file.

Basic operations:

- Add a task
- List tasks
- Remove a task

Example idea:

```python
# pseudo-outline
# load tasks from file
# show menu: list/add/remove/quit
# save tasks back to file
```

Improvements: add timestamps, task completion status, or a small GUI with Tkinter.
