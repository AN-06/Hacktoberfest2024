# Practice - Getting Started

Exercise: Build a simple profile saver.

Task:

- Create a script `profile_save.py` that asks for a user's name, age, and city.
- Save the information to a file called `profiles.txt` in a readable format.
- Add an option to list all saved profiles.

Hints:

- Use `input()` to read values.
- Use file open/write to store lines.
- Use `.split()` to parse saved lines when listing.

Stretch:

- Allow multiple entries and store them with a timestamp.
