# Your First Python Program

> Start writing Python code and run it locally.

## 👋 Hello, World!

The simplest Python program prints text to the console. Create a file named `hello.py` with:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Run it from a terminal:

```
python hello.py
```

## 📝 Taking Input from a User

Use the built-in `input()` to read text from the user:

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Hi, {name}!")
```

## 🔁 Running Python Interactively

You can also run Python interactively by typing `python` (or `python3`) in a terminal and entering code line-by-line.

## 🔧 Saving and Running a Script

1. Create a file `script.py`.
2. Write your code inside.
3. Run `python script.py` in the terminal.

## 💡 Tips

- Use VS Code, PyCharm, or another editor with syntax highlighting.
- Keep scripts simple and test often.
