# Functions

Functions let you package code into reusable units. They make programs easier to read and test.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

Parameters are inputs, and a function can return a value. Functions can also have no return (they return None).

```python
def say_hi():
    print("Hi!")

say_hi()
```

Use functions to separate concerns and avoid repeating code.
