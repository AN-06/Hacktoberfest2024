# Practice - Core Concepts

Exercise: Create a small calculator script `calc.py`.

Task:

- Ask the user for two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /).
- Perform the operation and show the result.
- Handle divide-by-zero gracefully.

Hints:

- Convert inputs to `float` or `int` as needed.
- Use `try/except` for error handling.

Stretch:

- Add support for power `**` and modulus `%`.
