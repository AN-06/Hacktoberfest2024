Avoiding Conflicts: Syncing Your Fork
To avoid conflicts, add an 'upstream' to your git repository, as other PRs may be merged while you work on your branch/fork:

bash
Copy code
git remote add upstream https://github.com/fineanmol/Hacktoberfest2024
You can verify the new remote has been added with:

bash
Copy code
git remote -v
To pull new changes from your parent repository, run:

bash
Copy code
git merge upstream/master
This will highlight any conflicts, making it easier to resolve them. It‚Äôs a good practice to do this frequently to keep your repo updated.
